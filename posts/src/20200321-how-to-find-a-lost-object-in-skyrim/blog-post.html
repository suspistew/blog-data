<p>Recently, due to COVID-19, I returned to this awesome game called "Skyrim". At one point, I had to find an item that I accidentally lost. It was the golden claw that I stole from Riverhood after the quest.</p>

<p>I collect all the claws, so I needed to find it. I just didn't want to give myself a new one, so I decided to find it. No one has time to look all over Skyrim. So, to find a lost object, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to the console and tip <code>save test 1</code> then enter. (This will take some seconds, and will open a notepad with your game save)</li>
<li>Look in the opened save for the refID of your item</li>
<li>Go to the console and tip <code>player.moveto &lt;refID&gt;</code> (this will move you to the place where you lost your item :p)</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I'm concerned, the golden claw was in the evidences chest in Whiterun, I don't remember why, but at least I've found where it was.</p>
