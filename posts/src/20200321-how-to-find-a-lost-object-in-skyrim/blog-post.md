Recently, due to COVID-19, I returned to this awesome game called "Skyrim". At one point, I had to find an item that I accidentally lost. It was the golden claw that I stole from Riverhood after the quest.

I collect all the claws, so I needed to find it. I just didn't want to give myself a new one, so I decided to find it. No one has time to look all over Skyrim. So, to find a lost object, do the following:

- Go to the console and tip `save test 1` then enter. (This will take some seconds, and will open a notepad with your game save)
- Look in the opened save for the refID of your item
- Go to the console and tip `player.moveto <refID>` (this will move you to the place where you lost your item :p)

As far as I'm concerned, the golden claw was in the evidences chest in Whiterun, I don't remember why, but at least I've found where it was.
